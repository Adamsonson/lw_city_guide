# Wagon City Guides

When I finished my coding bootcamp with [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), my teacher Inou suggested that I create a city guide for Le Wagon Bali and keep practicing my coding skills. One freelance project and another front-end job later, I finally got to it.

I made Wagon City Guides for the drivers, community managers, and teachers of Le Wagon, so that they have a platform on which they can share their favorite spots with their students. At the same time, it's also a platform that the teachers themselves can use to find the best that Le Wagon city campuses have to offer when working abroad.

_Side note: Wagon City Guides is also part of my own "web dev MBA." You can find out more about that here: [Leap of Code - The Curriculum](https://www.mirhamasala.com/leap-of-code/#curriculum)_
